This is the source code directory for Sync-O-Matic 3000.  
Sync-O-Matic development has stopped since 2001.  This code is a complete rewrite 
from the Sync-O-Matic 2000 code.
<p>
Here are the elements which are available:
<ul>
<li>
<a href=synccode-b5.zip>The entire source code</a>
<p>
<li><a href=syncotest.htm>A subset of Sync-O-Matic code which
interacts with various ActiveX controls</a>
<p>
<li><a href=syncauto.zip>A demonstration application to show how to use
Sync-O-matic as an ActiveX application</a> - this way you can 
write a VB application and automate Sync-O-Matic yourself.
</ul>
<p>
The primary purpose of this source is for people to have their own archive copies
of the software.  If folks would like to move the 
source to SourceForge, I would be quite happy to participate to the extent I have time.
You can find the password to the zip file source code if you look at the source.
<!-- the password for the syncomatic zip file is codebob -->
